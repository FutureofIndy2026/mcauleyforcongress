      <h2>Why I am running</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Patrick McAuley, and I am proud to announce that I am running for the United States Congressional District IN-07 in the 2026 election year. This seat encompasses Washington Township, Wayne Township, Pike Township, Center Township, Warren, and parts of Perry. It essentially encompasses everything inside of I-465 and a few miles outside of it. Over the course of the past ten years, I have served various roles in local and federal politics from interning on Capitol Hill for Senator Todd Young and then Senator Mike Braun to volunteering for grassroots efforts right here in Indianapolis. Over that period of time, I have been exposed to opportunities I only dreamed of as a young man – walking the halls of the United States Capitol, sitting in on committee hearings with world leaders, and seeing firsthand the fighting spirit of Indiana leaders right here in our great City and in Washington D.C.
      </p>
      <p>
        I respect the hardworking and gritty mentality of our current elected officials. Senator Todd Young leads the charge on biotechnology and other cutting-edge policy areas while continuing to shape U.S. foreign policy on the world stage. Before Governor Braun was our Governor, he turned a small family business into a nationwide leader in its industry. Jefferson Shreve ran for Mayor in 2023, lost the election, and got right back up in 2024 to win a seat in the United States House of Representatives. These are the kinds of leaders I admire—and they inspire me to run for this seat.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up right here in Indianapolis and attended Wabash College in Crawfordsville, IN before getting a Masters in International Economics and Finance from Valparaiso University. This campaign is not about politics. It’s about fighting for the people of my hometown. It’s about being a voice for those who cannot speak. It’s about building our great City into the future and doing it together.
